### Backgrounds and goals

Internet of Things (IoT) is the general trend of upgrading
at least with reprogrammable firmware, remote control
capabilities, a wide array of various sensors, and wireless
connectivity devices which previously were considered to be
either pointless or impossible to do so. The major driver behind
this trend is the ever growing need for collecting a broad
spectrum of data and for efficiently mining them for their
latent value. Prime examples are houshold appliances such as
coffee machines and bed sensors which collect data regadring
how well one might sleep and how much coffee consumes
after four or eight hours of sleep. Although these data might
sound meaningless to collect and process, they may in fact
be of tremendous value to insurance companies and medical
researchers alike.
