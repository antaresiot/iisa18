### Backgrounds and goals

Internet of Things (IoT) is the general trend of upgrading at least with reprogrammable firmware, remote control capabilities, a wide array of various sensors, and wireless connectivity devices which previously were considered to be either pointless or impossible to do so. The major driver behind this trend is the ever growing need for collecting a broad spectrum of data and for efficiently mining them for their latent value. Prime examples are houshold appliances such as coffee machines and bed sensors which collect data regadring how well one might sleep and how much coffee consumes after four or eight hours of sleep. Although these data might sound meaningless to collect and process, they may in fact be of tremendous value to insurance companies and medical researchers alike.
